<p><strong>1. Original logo that served DreamHost for many years</strong></p>
<p>With the rebrand for DreamHost, we wanted to focus on the qualities that we felt set the company apart from the competition of other web hosting providers. As a company, we wanted to remain authentic, and passionate that cares about its community and users. For a tech company, DreamHost takes pride in shameless honesty, being irreverent and fun while still being professional. It was important to us that our values and personality came across which the original logo kinda lacked.</p>

<p><strong>2. Initial logo exploration</strong></p>
<p>The first stage was exploring updating the existing logo. How could we improve upon it? The original logo was set in Futura Condensed, which I feel was very common for many tech companies when it was designed. I explored new typefaces and different ways of incorporating the moon icon but still keeping it feeling familiar to the original logo.</p>

<p><strong>3. The wild card</strong></p>
<p>After a few rounds of exploration, we were asked if we could present one new concept that steered away from the original logo completely. I enjoyed the challenge and went off for a weekend mind mapping everything I could think of associated with Dream. The concept I presented was a dreamcatcher.</p>

<p> I thought this was a fun concept as it reminded me of the computer circuitry boards intertwining. The dreamcatcher is also a protection symbol, warding off bad dreams and only let the good ones through.</p>

<p><strong>3. The final logo chosen</strong></p>
<p>The dreamcatcher concept was presented at our quarterly all-hands meeting and was received very well. In the last round, the top three logos were set up to be voted on as a company. The logo chosen was a nice update to our original logo and still stayed within the familiar territory. It kept the camelcase lettering and setting the moon in a more upward positive direction.</p>
