<p><strong>1. Redesigning partners' promotional pages.</strong></p>
<p>DreamHost has multiple partners that send traffic for their users to get a promotional offer on hosting products. These pages are set up using a templet that can be customized to each partner including a large hero with the promotional offer, expiration date, and top features of the product. The current layout was not converting to our 2017 acquisition goals and needed a refresh.</p>

<p>We wanted to create a new page that would leverage that affiliate traffic better. On top of the clear price and savings, the design goals included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing better content that would help the user decide to buy web hosting.</li>
<li>Trust sections that include testimonials from current customers and trusted by partners.</li>
<li>Better feature section explaining how our products work and what our customers love about them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. New layout for conversion</strong></p>
<p>We kept the sections similar to the old page layout with the large hero followed by a feature section. I wanted to make the page feel more inviting and lighter by removing the dark blue background. The image used was also set to be more inviting than a computer screen. The testimonial came from our partner who is sending us the traffic on why they decide to use DreamHost. We included a small "Why DreamHost" section that described the company does differently and sets them apart from the competition.</p>
